K... I just finished project 1 of module 1 in the data science course. My mind feels like mush. There was a sleepless night, some mini panic attacks, and moments where I needed to be talked off the ledge by my instructors and peers alike. 


For our first project, we were given a housing data set and asked to build a model predicting housing prices using variables and a data set given to us including features of houses (square footage, etc.) that had been sold already. 
I started the project kind of confident that everything would be smooth, towards the middle I freaked out a lot because I realized how little I knew even though I thought I had already crammed so much into my brain, and by the end, I felt like I had more questions than answers (in a good way) and I am happy to report that I am even more excited to keep cramming stuff in this brain of mine. 

More to come!!!
